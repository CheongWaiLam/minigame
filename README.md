## Purpose
Software development process applied: **ï¼¡gile process.**

Reason of choose Agile process
  Agile is suitable for the situation where the requirements are not clear, because we a redoing software development for the first time, and the requirements are not very clear, so we need to gradually clarify the requirements in the process of continuous iteration.  Agile communication is usually much higher, and at the same time it is more flexible, requiring changes at almost any time. 
  With Waterfall, it is not easy to define the requirements clearly in the early stage, and the hypothetical requirements based on the early plans may have great risks.  Also, many communications in waterfall are one-way communication in the early stage, and the later projects are very different from the original expectations.
